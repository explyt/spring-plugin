## Features
### Key Features
- **Accurate Bean Detection**: Understand your Spring application with real bean data, even for complex configurations.
- **Built-in HTTP Client**: Test APIs using Swagger UI directly in your IDE.
- **Advanced Inspections**: Detect and fix issues in Spring configurations, beans, and annotations.
- **Spring Boot & Web Support**: Enhanced tools for Spring Boot, MVC, WebFlux, and more.
- **Kotlin-Friendly**: Full support for Kotlin Spring applications.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Runs a lightweight version of your app for accurate insights without slowing down your IDE.

### Our Innovative Approach

**Explyt Spring Plugin** uses a unique method to understand your Spring application thoroughly. Instead of analyzing only the source code, our plugin runs a lightweight version of your application to get accurate information about your Spring beans. This means:

- **Accurate Bean Detection**: We can detect beans that are conditionally loaded or defined through complex configurations.
- **Better Inspections**: By having real bean data, we reduce false warnings and provide more precise code inspections.
- **Improved Navigation and Completion**: Navigate to beans and get code completion suggestions based on actual bean definitions.

This approach ensures that even if your application uses advanced Spring features like `@Conditional`, complex `@ComponentScan` configurations, or custom conditions, the plugin understands them correctly.

### New Feature: Built-in HTTP Client Using Swagger UI

We are excited to introduce our **built-in HTTP client** for IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition,
integrated directly into the Explyt Spring Plugin.
This feature allows you to test and interact with HTTP APIs seamlessly within your IDE.

#### Key Advantages

- **No Custom DSL Needed**: Use familiar **Spring Web annotations** to define HTTP requests instead of learning a new domain-specific language (DSL).
- **Leverage Swagger UI**: We utilize **Swagger UI** to provide a rich interface for executing and analyzing HTTP requests.
- **Quick Setup**: Write methods with Spring annotations, and the plugin generates OpenAPI specifications automatically.
- **Familiar Tools**: Benefit from well-known technologies like Spring Web, OpenAPI, and Swagger UI.

#### How It Works

1. **Define HTTP Methods Using Spring Annotations**

   Write methods in Java or Kotlin using standard Spring Web annotations to describe the HTTP requests you want to make.

   ```java
   @GetMapping("https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather")
   public String getWeather() {
       // Implementation is not important
   }
   ```

2. **Generate OpenAPI Specification**

   The plugin analyzes your annotated methods and generates an OpenAPI file representing the API definitions.

3. **Launch Swagger UI in IntelliJ IDEA**

   With a simple click on the **Run** icon next to your method, the plugin opens Swagger UI inside the IDE using the generated OpenAPI file.

4. **Execute HTTP Requests**

   Use Swagger UI to fill in parameters, execute the requests, and view the responses—all within the IDE.

#### Benefits

- **Simplifies API Testing**: Quickly test external services or APIs without leaving your development environment.
- **No Extra UI Development**: By using Swagger UI, we avoid the need to create and maintain a custom user interface.
- **Familiar Workflow**: Developers comfortable with Spring and Swagger will find this approach intuitive.

#### Additional Features

- **Code Generators**
    - **Generate Methods from URLs or cURL Commands**: Use the **Generate** menu (`Alt+Ins`) inside a Java class or Kotlin file to create Spring Web methods based on a given URL or cURL command.
    - **Supports Java and Kotlin**: Works seamlessly with both languages.

- **Supports OpenAPI Editing**
    - **Edit OpenAPI Files**: If needed, you can directly edit the generated OpenAPI files. The plugin provides code completion and validation support for OpenAPI specifications.

- **Handles Common Issues**
    - **CORS Handling**: We implemented a custom request handler to bypass CORS issues when making web requests from the embedded browser.

#### Use Cases

- **Testing External APIs**: Ideal for experimenting with third-party services like weather APIs, payment gateways, etc.
- **Quick Prototyping**: Easily create and test API calls during development without switching tools.
- **Learning and Documentation**: Helps new team members understand API interactions by providing a visual interface.

### Two Ways to Test HTTP Requests
1. **Swagger UI Integration** (recommended for Spring annotation workflows).
2. **`.http`/`.rest` File Execution** (ideal for users familiar with IntelliJ HTTP Client or HttpYac).

Choose the method that best fits your workflow!

### Spring Core and Boot Enhancements

- **Advanced Inspections and Quick Fixes**:
    - **Property Key Validations**: Detects unused properties, duplicate keys, and keys that don't follow the kebab-case convention.
    - **Configuration Properties Support**: Navigate, complete, and validate `@ConfigurationProperties` classes.
        - **Nullable Parameters Check**: Warns if constructor parameters in `@ConfigurationProperties` classes are not nullable.
        - **Invalid Prefix Detection**: Finds empty, duplicate, or incorrectly formatted prefixes in `@ConfigurationProperties`.
        - **Configuration Verification**: Ensures `@ConfigurationProperties` classes are correctly registered with Spring.
    - **Bean Autowiring Checks**:
        - Reports if no beans are found for autowiring.
        - Alerts if multiple candidate beans cause ambiguity.
        - Checks for invalid use of `@Autowired` annotations.
    - **Proxy Method Usage Inspection**: Warns about incorrect use of proxy methods when `proxyBeanMethods` is set to false.
